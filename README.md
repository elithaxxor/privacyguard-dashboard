# PrivacyGuard - Network Privacy Dashboard

## Overview
PrivacyGuard is a comprehensive web-based dashboard for managing network privacy and routing. It provides an intuitive interface for controlling network interfaces, managing privacy tools (VPN, Proxy, Tor), and automating privacy-related tasks.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Modern web browser
- Root/Administrator privileges (for network interface management)

### Installation
1. Clone or extract the project:
```bash
unzip privacyguard.zip
cd privacyguard
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
1. Start the backend server:
```bash
python3 backend/app.py
```

2. In a new terminal, serve the frontend:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 -d frontend
```

3. Access the dashboard:
- Open http://localhost:8000 in your web browser
- Navigate to http://localhost:8000/reports.html for analytics

## Future Development Guide

### Web-Based vs GUI Application

#### Current Web-Based Approach
Pros:
- Platform-independent (runs in any modern browser)
- Easy to update and maintain (single codebase)
- Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Familiar web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Easy to extend with new features
- Can be accessed remotely if needed

Cons:
- Requires running two servers (backend and frontend)
- Browser security limitations
- Limited access to system-level features
- Requires network connectivity

#### Native GUI Alternative
Pros:
- Direct system integration
- Better performance
- More secure (no web vulnerabilities)
- Offline functionality
- Native look and feel

Cons:
- Platform-specific development needed
- More complex deployment
- Harder to update
- Limited UI framework options

### Recommendation
For PrivacyGuard's use case, continuing with the web-based approach is recommended because:
1. Privacy tools often need remote configuration
2. Web technologies offer rich visualization libraries
3. Easy to implement real-time updates
4. Cross-platform compatibility is important

However, consider building a native companion app for system-level operations.

### Suggested Improvements

#### Backend Enhancements
1. Authentication & Authorization
   - Implement user accounts
   - Role-based access control
   - API key authentication

2. Advanced Privacy Features
   - DNS leak protection
   - Traffic analysis prevention
   - Custom routing rules
   - Network traffic monitoring

3. Performance Optimization
   - Caching layer for frequent requests
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Background task queue

#### Frontend Improvements
1. User Experience
   - Dark mode support
   - Customizable dashboard layouts
   - More interactive visualizations
   - Mobile-responsive design improvements

2. Advanced Reporting
   - Export reports (PDF, CSV)
   - Custom date ranges
   - More detailed analytics
   - Alert configurations

3. Privacy Tools Integration
   - VPN provider integrations
   - Tor node status monitoring
   - Proxy chain configuration

#### Architecture Evolution
1. Containerization
   - Docker support
   - Docker Compose for easy deployment
   - Container orchestration

2. Microservices
   - Split into smaller services
   - Independent scaling
   - Better fault isolation

3. Security Hardening
